juncodes.com is a static site built with <a href="https://astro.build" target="__blank">Astro</a>.

I'll have to admit Frontend Design and Development is not my forte but thanks to Astro Templates, I was able to launch this site within a day.

It's a nice minimalistic blog template with light and dark theme suitable for content rich websites. Go give the original template maker some love <a href="https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano" target="__blank">here</a>!
