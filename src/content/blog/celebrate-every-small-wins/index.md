If you know me personally, you'd know that Jun is not really an outspoken extrovert. It took a lot of courage for me to articulate my thoughts into these bits and bytes but here I am writing a blog post.

### Skill issue. Really

Whenever I see peers from Twitter (yes, I still call it Twitter) or LinkedIn posts about their new projects, be it a demo or a real production app, I genuinely feel happy for them. Then the next second I would feel terrible myself for not being able to do something as good. That really crushed my confidence. Even more so being a backend developer has led me thinking that I'm not as good as a fullstack develepor (well that could be true). Impostor syndrome is real.

### I think you think

I got caught into thinking what others are thinking of me. But no more it's time to take back control.

> Finish your projects

That's what Aaron Francis said in his <a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/finish-your-projects" target="__blank">article</a> and that's what I'm going to do. He's is the most positive person in the developer world. It's impossible to not like him.

From now I will publish whatever I have built, perfect or not. Publish it, celebrate it like this unfiltered post of what's currently on my mind right now.
That's how it should be. Right?

Jun.
